/* ─── FAQS ─── */

    {
        q: "What is Interventional Radiology?",
        a: "Interventional Radiology (IR) is a medical specialty that uses advanced imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, CT) to guide minimally invasive treatments. Instead of open surgery, IR doctors treat conditions through pinhole-sized punctures — meaning less pain, faster recovery, and no scars.",
    },
    {
        q: "Is the procedure painful?",
        a: "Most IR procedures are done under local anaesthesia with mild sedation. Patients typically feel minimal discomfort — far less than traditional surgery. Many patients describe it as similar to getting a blood test.",
    },
    {
        q: "How long is the recovery?",
        a: "Recovery is significantly faster than surgery. For most procedures like varicose vein treatment or varicocele embolisation, patients can walk the same day and return to normal activities within 1-3 days.",
    },
    {
        q: "Will there be any scars?",
        a: "No visible scars. IR procedures are done through a needle puncture (2-3mm) — smaller than a pen tip. There are no surgical cuts and no stitches needed.",
    },
    {
        q: "Is this covered by insurance?",
        a: "Yes, most IR procedures are covered under health insurance policies. We recommend checking with your insurance provider. Our team can help you with documentation.",
    },
    {
        q: "How is this different from regular surgery?",
        a: "Traditional surgery requires large incisions, general anaesthesia, and several days of hospital stay. IR procedures use a pinhole entry point, local anaesthesia, and most patients go home the same day.",
