They occur when the valves inside veins stop working properly, causing blood to pool and the veins to swell. While they are extremely common — affecting up to 30% of adults — they are more than just a cosmetic concern.\n\nLeft untreated, varicose veins can lead to pain, heaviness, skin changes, swelling, and in severe cases, ulcers and blood clots. They are particularly common in people who stand for long hours, women (especially during pregnancy), and those with a family history of the condition.`

Gone are the days of painful stripping surgery with weeks of recovery.\n\nEndovenous Laser Ablation (EVLA) uses laser energy delivered through a thin fibre inserted into the affected vein under ultrasound guidance. The laser heats and seals the vein shut, and blood is naturally rerouted to healthy veins. The procedure takes 30-45 minutes, uses only local anaesthesia, and patients walk out the same day.\n\nVenaseal (medical glue) is an even newer option where a special adhesive is injected into the vein to seal it permanently. It requires no tumescent anaesthesia and has virtually zero downtime.\n\nBoth procedures are done through a single needle puncture — no cuts, no stitches, no scars.`

Since fibroids depend heavily on blood supply to grow, cutting off this supply causes them to soften and shrink. Normal uterine tissue has alternative blood supply and is not affected.\n\nMost patients stay overnight for pain management and go home the next morning.`

When varicoceles raise scrotal temperature, it can reduce sperm count, damage sperm motility (movement), cause abnormal sperm shape (morphology), and reduce testosterone production.\n\nVaricoceles are the most common identifiable and correctable cause of male infertility. After treatment, sperm parameters improve in 60-70% of men, and natural pregnancy rates improve significantly.`

        text: `Varicocele embolisation is a minimally invasive alternative to surgical repair. An interventional radiologist accesses the testicular vein through a small puncture in the wrist or neck. Using X-ray guidance, a catheter is navigated to the faulty vein, and tiny coils or a sclerosing agent is used to block the vein from the inside.\n\nBlood is then naturally rerouted through healthy veins. The entire procedure takes about 30-45 minutes under local anaesthesia. There is no incision in the groin or scrotum, and patients typically go home the same day.`

Recovery is faster — most men return to work in 1-2 days versus 1-2 weeks after surgery. General anaesthesia is not needed. There is very low risk of hydrocele (fluid collection), which can occur in up to 10% of surgical cases. And both testicles can be treated in a single sitting if needed.\n\nSuccess rates are comparable between embolisation and surgery, with both achieving over 90% technical success.`

You should consider treatment if you are experiencing infertility and semen analysis shows abnormal parameters, if there is testicular pain or heaviness, if the affected testicle is smaller than the other (testicular atrophy), or if you are an adolescent with a large varicocele and difference in testicular size.\n\nA simple physical examination and ultrasound can diagnose a varicocele. If you're struggling with fertility, getting evaluated for varicocele is an important step — it's one of the most treatable causes of male infertility.`

const FAQS = [
  { q: "What is Interventional Radiology?", a: "Interventional Radiology (IR) is a medical specialty that uses advanced imaging (X-ray, ultrasound, CT) to guide minimally invasive treatments. Instead of open surgery, IR doctors treat conditions through pinhole-sized punctures — meaning less pain, faster recovery, and no scars." },
  { q: "Is the procedure painful?", a: "Most IR procedures are done under local anaesthesia with mild sedation. Patients typically feel minimal discomfort — far less than traditional surgery. Many patients describe it as similar to getting a blood test." },
  { q: "How long is the recovery?", a: "Recovery is significantly faster than surgery. For most procedures like varicose vein treatment or varicocele embolisation, patients can walk the same day and return to normal activities within 1-3 days." },
  { q: "Will there be any scars?", a: "No visible scars. IR procedures are done through a needle puncture (2-3mm) — smaller than a pen tip. There are no surgical cuts and no stitches needed." },
  { q: "Is this covered by insurance?", a: "Yes, most IR procedures are covered under health insurance policies. We recommend checking with your insurance provider. Our team can help you with documentation." },
  { q: "How is this different from regular surgery?", a: "Traditional surgery requires large incisions, general anaesthesia, and several days of hospital stay. IR procedures use a pinhole entry point, local anaesthesia, and most patients go home the same day." },
